# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
my idea is a dapp that can be used by theatremakers to fundraise for their productions. 
the idea stems from a frustration with the way that government funding chooses productions. there are some guidelines but these can also be arbitrary. Since the arts council funding comes from the people's taxes - as in general society - what if general society (i.e. not only a handful of very wealthy producers) had more of a say in what proposed productions come to fruition? 
it would be a platform which allows theatre companies to accept crypto donations and auction NFTs
theatre companies create a profile stating their budget and goal amount for a production. investors can browse and find proposals of shows they would like to see created. (this will not be limited to location because the theatre companies can only create a profile if they offer a live stream of their production.) 
interested investors donate crypto to the projects and if the project hits it's funding goal, they receive the money and an NFT for that production is created. 
The NFT goes to the investor who gave the most money and they receive a .1% royalty in that NFT forever. So even though theatre shows are transient and finite - the value of the NFT continues because the original investor will always receive some profit from any subsequent sale of the NFT.
